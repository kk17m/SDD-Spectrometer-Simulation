# SDD-Spectrometer-Simulation
A Monte Carlo simulation code simulation code of silicon drift detectors (SDDs) for x-ray fluorescence and spectrometry applications. The simulation includes energy-dispersive photon counting detectors intended for spectrometry and molecular imaging. The detector is based on Amptek XR100 FastSDD X-ray  detector (Amptek Inc., Bedford, MA, USA).
